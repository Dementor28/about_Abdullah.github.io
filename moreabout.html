<h1>More About ME</h1>

<h2>How I chose Programming</h2>

    <p>
        My passion for programming primarily started from the day I was exposed to it. Once I learned
        what was possible with programming I was instantly into it.
        I started from kali Linux and moved to Python from there
    </p>
<h2> MY Skills</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>Business Administration</li>
        <li>Business Communications</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>My future goals</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Master C++ language</li>
        <p>I want to master C++ as it is the core language for almost every popular language that exists today.
            So knowing this language very well will help me learn other languages very easily
        </p>

        <li>Minor on a business program</li>
        <p>I love business as much as I love coding. As I have a very broad knowledge about business studies
            I think a minor won't be difficult to achieve.
        </p>
    </ul>
